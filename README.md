# edit-distance

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/febeling/edit-distance.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/febeling/edit-distance)

Calculate Levenshtein distance between two strings.

The Levenshtein edit distance is a measure for the similarity between
two strings. It's helpful for spelling correction, fuzzy completion,
type-ahead and similar use cases.

This implementation supports Unicode.

## Installation

In Cargo.toml add

```toml
[dependencies]
edit-distance = "2.1.0"
```

Then re-run `cargo build`. That fetches the dependencies and builds
the code.

## Usage

```rust
extern crate edit_distance;

edit_distance("kitten", "sitting"); // => 3
```

## Development

Test changes before comitting.

```shell
cargo clean
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo build
cargo test
```
